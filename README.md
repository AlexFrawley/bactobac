# BACtoBAC
This is a Hackyltics '23 Project created by Aishik Dhori, Alex Frawley, and Justin Xia.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
We wanted to create a blood alcohol content (BAC) tracking tool that was more accurate than what is currently availible. Most tools currently availlible 
use a simplified form of the Widmark Formula, which treats alcohol decay as linear and alcohol absorbtion as instantaneous. Obviously, this isn't a 
realistic represenation of how alcohol is metabolized, so we set about developing a better model and using it to create BACtoBAC, an app made for people 
to estimate their current BAC and predict it in the future.
<h2>How We Made It</h2>
We analyzed multiple scientific papers and datasets to create a more accurate model for how alcohol is absorbed and metabolized by the body. The rate
for which these processes occur is dependent upon many factors such as weight, sex, alcohol concentration of the drink, and more. We created multiple
that take these factors into account to create a better prediction than what is currently availible.
